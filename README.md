# Capstone-Projects II

## Purpose of the Project
The National Football League Super Bowl is a huge sporting spectacle in the Unites States of America. 
This spectacle is known for its crazy comebacks, expensive adverts and the nail-biting suspense 
and drama. The NFL Super Bowl halftime shows also normally have the biggest musicians in the 
world performing. In this dataset we are going to explore and discover how certain elements and 
variables interact with each other. 
After exploring and cleaning the dataset we have, we are going to answer questions like:

## Data being analysed
•	What are the most extreme game outcomes?
•	How does the game affect television viewership?
•	How viewership, TV ratings and advert costs evolved over time?
•	Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

## How the data is being analysed

## The Main Findings 
•	The findings and the discovery of the dataset lead me to know that huge margins and blowouts during the game lead to lost viewers during the course of the game.
•	The increase in the number of viewers and household rating lead to a higher ad cost for an advert during the Superbowl final
